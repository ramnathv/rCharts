<h2>The GNU General Public License (GPL) Version 2, June 1991
</h2>
<br>
<p>Copyright (C) 1989, 1991 Free Software Foundation, Inc. 59 Temple
Place, Suite 330, Boston, MA 02111-1307 USA</p>
<p>Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies of this
license document, but changing it is not allowed.</p>
<p style="font-weight: bold;">Preamble</p>
<p>The licenses for most software are designed to take away your
freedom to share and change it. By contrast, the GNU General Public
License is intended to guarantee your freedom to share and change free
software--to make sure the software is free for all its users. This
General Public License applies to most of the Free Software
Foundation's software and to any other program whose authors commit to
using it. (Some other Free Software Foundation software is covered by
the GNU Library General Public License instead.) You can apply it to
your programs, too.</p>
<p>When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not
price. Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you
have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for
this service if you wish), that you receive source code or can get it
if you want it, that you can change the software or use pieces of it in
new free programs; and that you know you can do these things.</p>
<p>To protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid
anyone to deny you these rights or to ask you to surrender the rights.
These restrictions translate to certain responsibilities for you if you
distribute copies of the software, or if you modify it.</p>
<p>For example, if you distribute copies of such a program, whether
gratis or for a fee, you must give the recipients all the rights that
you have. You must make sure that they, too, receive or can get the
source code. And you must show them these terms so they know their
rights.</p>
<p>We protect your rights with two steps: (1) copyright the software,
and (2) offer you this license which gives you legal permission to
copy, distribute and/or modify the software.</p>
<p>Also, for each author's protection and ours, we want to make certain
that everyone understands that there is no warranty for this free
software. If the software is modified by someone else and passed on, we
want its recipients to know that what they have is not the original, so
that any problems introduced by others will not reflect on the original
authors' reputations.</p>
<p>Finally, any free program is threatened constantly by software
patents. We wish to avoid the danger that redistributors of a free
program will individually obtain patent licenses, in effect making the
program proprietary. To prevent this, we have made it clear that any
patent must be licensed for everyone's free use or not licensed at all.</p>
<p>The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and
modification follow.</p>
<p style="font-weight: bold;">TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING,
DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">0.</span> This License applies to
any program or other work which contains a notice placed by the
copyright holder saying it may be distributed under the terms of this
General Public License. The "Program", below, refers to any such
program or work, and a "work based on the Program" means either the
Program or any derivative work under copyright law: that is to say, a
work containing the Program or a portion of it, either verbatim or with
modifications and/or translated into another language. (Hereinafter,
translation is included without limitation in the term "modification".)
Each licensee is addressed as "you".</p>
<p>Activities other than copying, distribution and modification are not
covered by this License; they are outside its scope. The act of running
the Program is not restricted, and the output from the Program is
covered only if its contents constitute a work based on the Program
(independent of having been made by running the Program). Whether that
is true depends on what the Program does.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">1.</span> You may copy and
distribute verbatim copies of the Program's source code as you receive
it, in any medium, provided that you conspicuously and appropriately
publish on each copy an appropriate copyright notice and disclaimer of
warranty; keep intact all the notices that refer to this License and to
the absence of any warranty; and give any other recipients of the
Program a copy of this License along with the Program.</p>
<p>You may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy,
and you may at your option offer warranty protection in exchange for a
fee.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">2.</span> You may modify your copy
or copies of the Program or any portion of it, thus forming a work
based on the Program, and copy and distribute such modifications or
work under the terms of Section 1 above, provided that you also meet
all of these conditions:</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>a) You must cause the modified files to carry prominent notices
stating that you changed the files and the date of any change.</p>
  <p>b) You must cause any work that you distribute or publish, that in
whole or in part contains or is derived from the Program or any part
thereof, to be licensed as a whole at no charge to all third parties
under the terms of this License.</p>
  <p>c) If the modified program normally reads commands interactively
when run, you must cause it, when started running for such interactive
use in the most ordinary way, to print or display an announcement
including an appropriate copyright notice and a notice that there is no
warranty (or else, saying that you provide a warranty) and that users
may redistribute the program under these conditions, and telling the
user how to view a copy of this License. (Exception: if the Program
itself is interactive but does not normally print such an announcement,
your work based on the Program is not required to print an
announcement.)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>These requirements apply to the modified work as a whole. If
identifiable sections of that work are not derived from the Program,
and can be reasonably considered independent and separate works in
themselves, then this License, and its terms, do not apply to those
sections when you distribute them as separate works. But when you
distribute the same sections as part of a whole which is a work based
on the Program, the distribution of the whole must be on the terms of
this License, whose permissions for other licensees extend to the
entire whole, and thus to each and every part regardless of who wrote
it.</p>
<p>Thus, it is not the intent of this section to claim rights or
contest your rights to work written entirely by you; rather, the intent
is to exercise the right to control the distribution of derivative or
collective works based on the Program.</p>
<p>In addition, mere aggregation of another work not based on the
Program with the Program (or with a work based on the Program) on a
volume of a storage or distribution medium does not bring the other
work under the scope of this License.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">3.</span> You may copy and
distribute the Program (or a work based on it, under Section 2) in
object code or executable form under the terms of Sections 1 and 2
above provided that you also do one of the following:</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>a) Accompany it with the complete corresponding machine-readable
source code, which must be distributed under the terms of Sections 1
and 2 above on a medium customarily used for software interchange; or,</p>
  <p>b) Accompany it with a written offer, valid for at least three
years, to give any third party, for a charge no more than your cost of
physically performing source distribution, a complete machine-readable
copy of the corresponding source code, to be distributed under the
terms of Sections 1 and 2 above on a medium customarily used for
software interchange; or,</p>
  <p>c) Accompany it with the information you received as to the offer
to distribute corresponding source code. (This alternative is allowed
only for noncommercial distribution and only if you received the
program in object code or executable form with such an offer, in accord
with Subsection b above.)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The source code for a work means the preferred form of the work for
making modifications to it. For an executable work, complete source
code means all the source code for all modules it contains, plus any
associated interface definition files, plus the scripts used to control
compilation and installation of the executable. However, as a special
exception, the source code distributed need not include anything that
is normally distributed (in either source or binary form) with the
major components (compiler, kernel, and so on) of the operating system
on which the executable runs, unless that component itself accompanies
the executable.</p>
<p>If distribution of executable or object code is made by offering
access to copy from a designated place, then offering equivalent access
to copy the source code from the same place counts as distribution of
the source code, even though third parties are not compelled to copy
the source along with the object code.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">4.</span> You may not copy, modify,
sublicense, or distribute the Program except as expressly provided
under this License. Any attempt otherwise to copy, modify, sublicense
or distribute the Program is void, and will automatically terminate
your rights under this License. However, parties who have received
copies, or rights, from you under this License will not have their
licenses terminated so long as such parties remain in full compliance.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">5.</span> You are not required to
accept this License, since you have not signed it. However, nothing
else grants you permission to modify or distribute the Program or its
derivative works. These actions are prohibited by law if you do not
accept this License. Therefore, by modifying or distributing the
Program (or any work based on the Program), you indicate your
acceptance of this License to do so, and all its terms and conditions
for copying, distributing or modifying the Program or works based on it.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">6.</span> Each time you
redistribute the Program (or any work based on the Program), the
recipient automatically receives a license from the original licensor
to copy, distribute or modify the Program subject to these terms and
conditions. You may not impose any further restrictions on the
recipients' exercise of the rights granted herein. You are not
responsible for enforcing compliance by third parties to this License.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">7.</span> If, as a consequence of a
court judgment or allegation of patent infringement or for any other
reason (not limited to patent issues), conditions are imposed on you
(whether by court order, agreement or otherwise) that contradict the
conditions of this License, they do not excuse you from the conditions
of this License. If you cannot distribute so as to satisfy
simultaneously your obligations under this License and any other
pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you may not distribute the
Program at all. For example, if a patent license would not permit
royalty-free redistribution of the Program by all those who receive
copies directly or indirectly through you, then the only way you could
satisfy both it and this License would be to refrain entirely from
distribution of the Program.</p>
<p>If any portion of this section is held invalid or unenforceable
under any particular circumstance, the balance of the section is
intended to apply and the section as a whole is intended to apply in
other circumstances.</p>
<p>It is not the purpose of this section to induce you to infringe any
patents or other property right claims or to contest validity of any
such claims; this section has the sole purpose of protecting the
integrity of the free software distribution system, which is
implemented by public license practices. Many people have made generous
contributions to the wide range of software distributed through that
system in reliance on consistent application of that system; it is up
to the author/donor to decide if he or she is willing to distribute
software through any other system and a licensee cannot impose that
choice.</p>
<p>This section is intended to make thoroughly clear what is believed
to be a consequence of the rest of this License.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">8.</span> If the distribution
and/or use of the Program is restricted in certain countries either by
patents or by copyrighted interfaces, the original copyright holder who
places the Program under this License may add an explicit geographical
distribution limitation excluding those countries, so that distribution
is permitted only in or among countries not thus excluded. In such
case, this License incorporates the limitation as if written in the
body of this License.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">9.</span> The Free Software
Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions of the General
Public License from time to time. Such new versions will be similar in
spirit to the present version, but may differ in detail to address new
problems or concerns.</p>
<p>Each version is given a distinguishing version number. If the
Program specifies a version number of this License which applies to it
and "any later version", you have the option of following the terms and
conditions either of that version or of any later version published by
the Free Software Foundation. If the Program does not specify a version
number of this License, you may choose any version ever published by
the Free Software Foundation.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">10.</span> If you wish to
incorporate parts of the Program into other free programs whose
distribution conditions are different, write to the author to ask for
permission. For software which is copyrighted by the Free Software
Foundation, write to the Free Software Foundation; we sometimes make
exceptions for this. Our decision will be guided by the two goals of
preserving the free status of all derivatives of our free software and
of promoting the sharing and reuse of software generally.</p>
<p>NO WARRANTY</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">11.</span> BECAUSE THE PROGRAM IS
LICENSED FREE OF CHARGE, THERE IS NO WARRANTY FOR THE PROGRAM, TO THE
EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW. EXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE STATED IN
WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND/OR OTHER PARTIES PROVIDE THE PROGRAM
"AS IS" WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED,
INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF
MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. THE ENTIRE RISK
AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE PROGRAM IS WITH YOU. SHOULD
THE PROGRAM PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE COST OF ALL NECESSARY
SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">12.</span> IN NO EVENT UNLESS
REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN WRITING WILL ANY COPYRIGHT
HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MAY MODIFY AND/OR REDISTRIBUTE THE
PROGRAM AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY
GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF
THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE PROGRAM (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
LOSS OF DATA OR DATA BEING RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY
YOU OR THIRD PARTIES OR A FAILURE OF THE PROGRAM TO OPERATE WITH ANY
OTHER PROGRAMS), EVEN IF SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF
THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.</p>
<p>END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS</p>
<p style="font-weight: bold;">How to Apply These Terms to Your New
Programs</p>
<p>If you develop a new program, and you want it to be of the greatest
possible use to the public, the best way to achieve this is to make it
free software which everyone can redistribute and change under these
terms.</p>
<p>To do so, attach the following notices to the program. It is safest
to attach them to the start of each source file to most effectively
convey the exclusion of warranty; and each file should have at least
the "copyright" line and a pointer to where the full notice is found.</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>One line to give the program's name and a brief idea of what it
does.</p>
  <p>Copyright (C)</p>
  <p>This program is free software; you can redistribute it and/or
modify it under the terms of the GNU General Public License as
published by the Free Software Foundation; either version 2 of the
License, or (at your option) any later version.</p>
  <p>This program is distributed in the hope that it will be useful,
but WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of
MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. See the GNU
General Public License for more details.</p>
  <p>You should have received a copy of the GNU General Public License
along with this program; if not, write to the Free Software Foundation,
Inc., 59 Temple Place, Suite 330, Boston, MA 02111-1307 USA</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Also add information on how to contact you by electronic and paper
mail.</p>
<p>If the program is interactive, make it output a short notice like
this when it starts in an interactive mode:</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>Gnomovision version 69, Copyright (C) year name of author<br>
Gnomovision comes with ABSOLUTELY NO WARRANTY; for details type
`show w'. This is free software, and you are welcome to redistribute it
under certain conditions; type `show c' for details.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The hypothetical commands `show w' and `show c' should show the
appropriate parts of the General Public License. Of course, the
commands you use may be called something other than `show w' and `show
c'; they could even be mouse-clicks or menu items--whatever suits your
program.</p>
<p>You should also get your employer (if you work as a programmer) or
your school, if any, to sign a "copyright disclaimer" for the program,
if necessary. Here is a sample; alter the names:</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>Yoyodyne, Inc., hereby disclaims all copyright interest in the
program `Gnomovision' (which makes passes at compilers) written by
James Hacker.</p>
  <p>signature of Ty Coon, 1 April 1989<br>
Ty Coon, President of Vice</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This General Public License does not permit incorporating your
program into proprietary programs. If your program is a subroutine
library, you may consider it more useful to permit linking proprietary
applications with the library. If this is what you want to do, use the
GNU Library General Public License instead of this License.</p>
