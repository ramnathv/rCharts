  The `ts` package was added in R version 0.65.0 and significantly improved with release 1.5.0 in April 2002.  There is a very good discussion of the improvements in Brian Ripley's ["Time Series in R 1.5.0" from Volume 2 of R News, June 2002](http://cran.r-project.org/doc/Rnews/Rnews_2002-2.pdf).  `plot.ts()` added some nice features, such as the ability to plot multiple/wide time series, specify panels per series, and easily calculate acf, ARIMA,and HoltWinters.

  R 1.5.0 was a very important milestone for both graphing and time series analysis with the release of `lattice` (Deepayan Sarkar) and `gri`d (Paul Murrell) and also the improvements in `ts` mentioned above., All of these are covered in [Volume 2 of R News, June 2002](http://cran.r-project.org/doc/Rnews/Rnews_2002-2.pdf).  `lattice` using `grid` as its platform began an era of aesthetically pleasing and production-quality graphics straight from R.

  `zoo` made it easier to work with irregular time series in R and bridged the gap. `plot.zoo()` allowed us `plot.ts()` functionality for zoo objects.
